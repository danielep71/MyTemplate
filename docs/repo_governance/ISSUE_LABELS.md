# 🏷️ Issue labels & automation

![Labels](https://img.shields.io/badge/labels-20-1D76DB)

This repository defines 20 issue labels, each with a name, description, and colour. `.github/labels.json` is authoritative; edit it through a pull request. `prune: true` removes labels outside the catalogue, including their issue associations.

## ⚙️ Automation

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Sync issue labels | Validates pull requests; reconciles labels after a catalogue change lands on the default branch or a manual run on the default branch. Verifies the exact live result. |
| Detect issue-label drift | Checks daily at 05:17 UTC and manually; PR runs use offline fixtures. Reports drift without modifying labels. |
| Issue triage | Audits open issues on issue events or manual runs. Reports missing assignee, priority, milestone, dependency section, invalid labels, and inconsistent blocked status. |
| Keep milestones issue-only | Removes any milestone set on a pull request, on each pull-request event and in a daily and manual scan of every pull request. It never checks out pull-request code. |
| Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) | Opens weekly grouped pull requests for the SHA-pinned GitHub Actions and the pinned configuration parser, labelled `ci` and `P3` and assigned to me. Nothing merges automatically. |

Among these workflows, only synchronization has `issues: write` and only *Keep milestones issue-only* has `pull-requests: write`; outside them, only the optional traffic-alert job writes issues ([TRAFFIC.md](TRAFFIC.md)). `tests/test_workflow_controls.py` fails if any other job gains a write permission. PR validation is read-only. Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.

## 🚀 New repository

1. Enable Actions and run **Sync issue labels** from the default branch. GitHub template creation copies files; run synchronization to establish the live labels.
2. To add labels for a generated repository, such as one per regulatory regime, add them to the `labels` list in `.github/labels.json`, sorted case-insensitively by name, then add each one to the catalogue and usage tables below and update the label counts. **Repository integrity** checks all three.
3. My GitHub account, `danielep71`, is the assignee in the four issue forms (`assignees`) and in `.github/dependabot.yml`; the triage check reads it from `bug.yml`. If someone else maintains a generated repository, replace my account in those five files. **Repository integrity** fails if they disagree.
4. Create project milestones, give each open issue exactly one priority and a milestone, and assign it to me (or the account configured for a generated repository). Use `blocked` only for a named open prerequisite or `External condition:`. P1 is reserved for confirmed calculation bugs.
5. Label validation covers pull requests to every branch. Live synchronization runs only on the current default branch, including after a rename.

**Keep** the label manifest, scripts, all four workflows, issue forms, triage checker/tests, and this guide after bootstrap. They provide ongoing maintenance and must not be deleted with one-time repository setup files.

## 🧭 Using the labels

Every issue has exactly one priority and the type labels that fit the work. Pull requests carry the labels of the work they deliver; milestones belong to issues only, and *Keep milestones issue-only* removes any milestone set on a pull request.

### Priorities

| Label | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `P1` | Reserved for a confirmed calculation bug: wrong results for valid inputs. Only together with `bug`; never for setup, documentation, or tooling work. |
| `P2` | Material correctness, robustness, or maintainability defect. Default of the bug and private security contact forms. |
| `P3` | Non-blocking quality, testing, documentation, setup, or technical-debt work. Default of the enhancement and documentation forms and of Dependabot pull requests. |

A form sets the default priority; triage confirms or changes it. Raise a bug to `P1` only once the calculation defect is confirmed.

### Types

| Label | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `bug` | A confirmed defect. The bug form sets it. |
| `enhancement` | New capability or improvement. The enhancement form sets it. |
| `documentation` | Documentation work. The documentation form sets it. |
| `behavior-change` | Add to work that changes externally observable behavior, such as computed results or input and output layouts. |
| `refactor` | Restructuring that preserves supported behavior. If supported behavior changes, use `behavior-change` instead. |
| `tests` | Regression coverage, test harnesses, fixtures, or manual validation. |
| `ci` | Workflows and automated checks, including Dependabot updates of the Actions. |
| `repository` | Repository structure, governance, metadata, or tooling. |
| `release` | Release preparation, certification, evidence, packaging, or publication. |
| `security` | Hardening and supply-chain work, and private security contact requests, which never contain vulnerability details. Never for an undisclosed vulnerability: report it as `SECURITY.md` describes. |

### Status and triage

| Label | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `blocked` | A prerequisite named in the dependency section, as an issue link or an `External condition:` line, is unresolved. Remove it once all are resolved; ready issues carry no status label. |
| `question` | I need information or a decision before the work can proceed. |
| `help wanted` | I welcome outside investigation, implementation, validation, or review. |
| `good first issue` | Well-scoped task suitable for a first contribution. |
| `duplicate` | Close the issue and link the issue or pull request that already covers the work. |
| `invalid` | Close the issue: it is incomplete, unsupported, or not actionable as submitted. |
| `wontfix` | Close the issue: I have decided not to do this work. |

## ✅ Closing issues

Close an issue as completed only when linked evidence meets its acceptance criteria, and check an acceptance box only when that evidence demonstrates it. When the issue is closed, add a **Resolution** section to its body with:

- links to the change (pull request and commit);
- the checks actually run, with their results;
- what was not validated, and any accepted limitation.

Close for another reason (duplicate, not planned, or superseded) only with an explicit explanation; the `duplicate`, `invalid`, and `wontfix` rows above say which label applies. Record material scope or policy decisions in the issue, pull request, or commit description.

Pull requests opened by Dependabot or another bot carry the labels of the work and no milestone. During triage, link each one to an existing issue or a new tracking issue, and give that issue the milestone.

## Offline issue audit

Export issues in GitHub REST JSON format, then identify the repository explicitly so dependency URLs resolve correctly. The audit needs Python 3.11+ and Node.js, because it validates the catalogue with the synchronization script:

```sh
python tools/check_issues.py --input issues.json --repo-name OWNER/REPOSITORY
```

Triage accepts only the labels defined in `.github/labels.json`.
