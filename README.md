# MyTemplate

I use this template to start repositories for regulatory risk calculation
workbooks, such as SA-CCR, SFT, FRTB, LCR, and NSFR. It provides:

- editing and Git policies for Excel workbooks, exported VBA source, and
  byte-preserved regulatory source copies;
- issue labels, issue forms, a pull request template with a final-head review
  procedure, triage automation, and a workflow that keeps milestones on issues
  only;
- a documented GitHub settings baseline, including security features, applied
  and verified by a script that also writes a dated evidence record;
- quality gates: Ruff, strict mypy and actionlint, plus tests that hold the
  workflows to pinned actions, explicit permissions and the required check, and
  link checks: relative links and anchors on every change, external links weekly;
- a security policy, Dependabot updates for the pinned Actions and the
  hash-locked Python dependencies, and optional daily traffic collection.

## 🚀 Start a new repository

GitHub copies files from a template, not its settings. In order:

1. Create the repository with **Use this template**.
2. Delete the template-only section of `AGENTS.md`, with its markers, point
   the two contact links in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` to the new
   repository, and set `target-branch` in `.github/dependabot.yml` to its
   release branch or remove it. **Repository integrity** fails until you do.
3. Enable Actions and let **Repository integrity** pass on the default branch.
4. Apply and verify the settings baseline, as the
   [repository setup guide](docs/setup/REPOSITORY_SETUP.md) describes. It
   needs Python 3.11+ and GitHub CLI authentication with administrator access:

   ```sh
   python tools/setup_repository.py --repo OWNER/NEW-REPO
   python tools/setup_repository.py --repo OWNER/NEW-REPO --apply
   python tools/setup_repository.py --repo OWNER/NEW-REPO --check \
     --report docs/repo_governance/SETTINGS_EVIDENCE.md
   ```

5. Run **Sync issue labels** and create milestones with due dates
   ([issue labels](docs/repo_governance/ISSUE_LABELS.md)).
6. Optionally, enable traffic collection
   ([traffic history](docs/repo_governance/TRAFFIC.md)).
7. If Codex reviews your pull requests, create its environment for the new
   repository ([pull request review](docs/repo_governance/PULL_REQUESTS.md)).

The [settings reference](docs/repo_governance/SETTINGS.md) and its
[JSON configuration](docs/setup/repository-settings.json) describe the baseline.
