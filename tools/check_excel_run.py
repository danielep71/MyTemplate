"""Check the evidence of an Excel run of the VBA harness against one commit.

The harness runs only in Excel, by hand or through tools/devbuild/excel_run.py
(INSTALLATION.md, Recording an Excel run). This reads what that run left in an
evidence folder and checks it against the candidate commit, without Excel.
The evidence layout, the suite, the modes and the supported host are
configured once, in .github/excel-evidence-policy.json as the candidate commit
holds it, and docs/methodology/TEST_HARNESS.md describes them:

- source identity: the modules exported back from the workbook equal, line
  for line, the commit's VBA components, each form's .frx equals the
  commit's byte for byte, and none is missing or extra. Code outside string
  literals and comments is compared without letter case, because the VBE
  re-cases every use of a name (HB-01): a re-cased identifier is a note, not a
  finding. In a document module, the attributes Excel writes itself are not
  compared (DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES);
- the three logs saved with TEST_Harness.SaveLog: each holds, record for
  record, what the commit's suite writes in its mode (no record missing,
  extra or out of order, no ERROR), with cleanup PASS and no recovery: the
  normal run passes with every case and assertion; the injected-failure run
  fails only its designated assertion, with the expected value the suite
  injects, an actual value that differs and the same values in its ASSERT,
  FAILURE and PRIMARY_FAILURE records; the skipped-case run lacks only the
  last case and fails only harness.completeness; all three come from one
  host of the policy's bitness; a normal run that is INCOMPLETE is rejected as such;
- certification.log, written by TEST_Harness.EndCertification: each mode
  ended as it must, the two failure modes reaching their caller as
  ERR_TEST_FAILED, and CERTIFICATION=PASS with COMPLETE;
- each project suite the policy lists under "suites": its normal-run log
  holds what the suite writes, passes and is COMPLETE, from the same host,
  and its own certification log records that run and CERTIFICATION=PASS.
  A suite that records results names its own results file, which its
  certification entry point saves after its normal run. A suite's cases are
  the Case procedures its runner (RunSuite, or the entry's "runner") calls.
  A policy that names a volume benchmark (a TEST_Benchmark module) as the
  harness or a suite is rejected.
  Every suite is read as the policy's Office bitness compiles it, so a case
  or assertion inside #If Win64 counts only on the host it runs on;
- host.txt, the host record: who ran it, when it started and finished (with
  the UTC offset), Windows, the Excel build and bitness, the macro policy
  (AutomationSecurity) and the Trust access to the VBA project as found, the
  references (exactly those of the policy), that Debug > Compile VBAProject
  completed, and the outcome. An outcome other than PASS is evidence of that
  outcome, never of a pass. A run that did not pass, because it ended FAIL or
  stopped early, may write UNKNOWN for a
  value it could not read, but no record may leave unread who ran it, when
  or how it ended;
- results.json, written by TEST_Harness.SaveResults after the example suite's
  normal run, and the results file each project suite names, when the commit
  holds accuracy contracts (tests/accuracy/contracts.json):
  tools/check_accuracy.py measures them on all these files together, against
  the commit's own test cases, so the results must be of the commit, held by
  one file only, cover every output of the contracts' cases, lie within each
  output's tolerance and within each contract's threshold. A contract's
  target is only reported: its Accuracy line says when it was missed. A
  holdout is measured only once its first exposure is in
  tests/accuracy/holdout_exposures.json at the commit certified (the
  --equivalent-to or --carried-to commit, else --commit): a draft contract's holdout is
  sealed, and a frozen contract's with no exposure under its decision is
  sealed and fails the run (tools/check_accuracy.py --record-holdout records
  it). This measurement of a recorded holdout is a regression and records
  nothing; its Accuracy line gives the number of exposures. The
  results must also cover every output the registry's invariants read and
  keep each invariant, whatever any contract's status; each invariant has an
  Accuracy line of its own;
- with --workbook, the binding of the export to the workbook it came from:
  export-manifest.json (tools/devbuild/export_manifest.py) records the
  SHA-256 of the workbook and of every exported file, and the workbook's
  build stamp names the commit. The binding is VERIFIED, FAIL, or UNVERIFIED
  when no workbook or manifest is given; --require-binding fails anything
  but VERIFIED;
- a workbook built with tools/devbuild/build_workbook.py --override, which
  its build stamp names, or a results file that such a workbook wrote: it is
  never evidence for the commit, and the check names it as such.

Without an exported folder, --workbook proves source identity instead by
rebuild: the commit is checked out in a temporary worktree and built with
tools/devbuild/build_workbook.py, and the workbook Excel ran, closed without
saving, must hold the same parts as that build, in the same order and byte for
byte once decompressed (binding VERIFIED, or FAIL). The parts, not the
compressed package, are compared, because another platform's zlib may pack
the same parts into other bytes. This proves that the workbook holds the
commit's source. That project holds no compiled code, so Excel reads it from
source and compiles each module when it is first used (HB-05): the code that
ran is the commit's. Only a run checked this way may record compile=ON_DEMAND,
as tools/devbuild/excel_run.py records it: no automated run can compile the
whole project without Trust access to the VBA project, so VBA compiled only
the modules the run called, each when it was first used. Any other run must
record compile=PASS from Debug > Compile VBAProject, which a person can run
without Trust access.

With --equivalent-to, one run certifies another commit too: the evidence is
checked against --commit, the commit the workbook was built from, exactly as
above, binding included, and then every run input must have the same Git blob
at both commits, none added or removed. The run inputs are the files that
decide what a build writes, what Excel runs and what this check reads:

- every VBA component and form resource of the tree, which source identity
  compares;
- every file in a directory of a configuration of tools/devbuild/workbook.json
  at either commit, and in src/workbook/, the home of the document modules
  and of the layout template;
- every file the accuracy check reads (CASE_PATHS): the methodology guides,
  the fixtures, which the suites also read, the expected results and the
  accuracy contracts, but not the holdout exposure record: it states which
  exposures happened, each bound by its hashes to run inputs, and the
  accuracy measurement reads it from the commit to certify, so the run that
  exposed a holdout also certifies the commit that records the exposure;
- every .gitattributes file of the tree, at the root or in any directory,
  since each one can change the bytes Git checks these files out with;
- tools/devbuild/workbook.json itself, the layout template, the evidence
  policy and the build tools (BUILD_TOOLS). A rebuild uses the build tools of
  the checkout that runs this check, so they must be those of the build.

A run input that differs, or exists at only one commit, is a finding that
names it. This check is not a run input: run it from a checkout of the
commit to certify. The workbook's stamp and the results still name the
commit it was built from, so the report names both commits.

With --carried-to, a run is carried to a commit that changes only comments or
layout in VBA components: the evidence is checked against --commit as with
--equivalent-to, and every run input must have the same Git blob at both
commits, except a VBA component (.bas, .cls, .frm) present at both that holds
the same code, as tools/vba_code_identity.py compares it: comments, line
continuations, blank lines, white space between tokens and the letter case of
code may differ, nothing else. A form's .frx stays byte for byte, and a
component added, removed or renamed is a finding. A component that uses [ or
] outside a string literal is never carried. The report labels the result
"Carried from <run commit>" with the components carried. The label is derived
on every check and never written anywhere: carried evidence is not evidence
of the exact commit, and a release accepts only a run of the candidate or one
--equivalent-to proves identical.

It proves only that this evidence is consistent with the commit. It does not
run Excel, and a PASS validates a calculation only as far as the commit's
accuracy contracts and their reference values do.
